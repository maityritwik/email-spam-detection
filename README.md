# 📱 SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning 🤖

Welcome to the **SMS Spam Detection** project! This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and traditional ML algorithms.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Spam messages are a nuisance! This project leverages data science and machine learning to automatically detect whether a given SMS message is spam or not.

🔍 **Tech Highlights:**
- Text preprocessing using `sklearn` and `NLTK`
- Feature extraction with `TfidfVectorizer`
- Classification using `Multinomial Naive Bayes`
- Model persistence using `pickle`
- Exploratory Data Analysis and visualizations

## 📝 How to do it

Some visuals from the link [Spam Detector](https://email-spam-detection-mbzwabnxvm2yurzqys22pq.streamlit.app/) I created to detect whether email/sms is a Spam or Not Spam:

## 🛠️ How to Use

### ✅ Requirements

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## 🧪 Run the Notebook
Open and run the Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook sms-spam-detection.ipynb
```
It contains everything from loading the data to training the model and evaluating results.

---

## 📦 Model Inference (Optional Script)

```python
To use the trained model for prediction:
import pickle

with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as mfile, open('vectorizer.pkl', 'rb') as vfile:
    model = pickle.load(mfile)
    vectorizer = pickle.load(vfile)

def predict_sms(text):
    vec = vectorizer.transform([text])
    return model.predict(vec)[0]

print(predict_sms("Congratulations! You've won a free iPhone. Click here!"))

```
